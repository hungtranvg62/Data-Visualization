You can access our demo via this link: https://youtu.be/LiEaeDn_ZSQ

The raw data downloaded from kaggle is in the `raw_data.csv` file

We preprocess the raw data with Python via Kaggle Notebook, you can find the `.ipynb` file here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/hieupc/data-viz. To run, click `Edit my copy`.

The cleaned data is then extracted to a new `.csv` file: `cleaned_data.csv`
